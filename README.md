## What is .NET Core?
.NET Core is a free, open-source, modular, cross-platform framework developed by Microsoft for building modern, high-performance applications. It is a reimplementation of the .NET Framework to be more lightweight, modular, and flexible.

.NET Core includes a runtime, a set of libraries, and a development environment that supports multiple programming languages such as C#, Visual Basic, and F#. It is designed to run on various platforms, including Windows, macOS, and Linux. It can be used to build a wide range of applications, including web applications, desktop applications, and microservices.
